On the other hand, this interaction is, as we mentioned, very sensitive to changes in the system. These changes can come from two sources: the instrument itself, such as in changes in the constants that drive the friction or elasticity components, or the player, through the way she controls (or plays) the instrument, such as the relative instantaneous velocity between bow and string, or the exerted force on it. We will call these sources of change the _model space_, for the ones due to the instrument, and the _control space_, for the ones due to the player. Notice that the model space is expected to be adjusted beforehand and mantained constant during the performance, while the control space is expected to vary and is where the art of playing bowed strings is.

### Spatial mappings

In 1973, Schelleng defined a parametrized mapping between the control and acoustic spaces [(Schelleng, 1973)][Schelleng1973]: given a projection of the control space that only takes into account bow force and relative distance between the contact point of bow and string and the bridge, there are three regions separated by two lines that correspond to different sound characteristics: the expected periodic motion in the middle, raucous sound on one side, and surface sound on the other. These areas have been further divided in the literature: within the raucous region two different regimes can take place: aperiodic motion, and anomalous low frequency oscillations. Within the lower surface sounding region, two different regimes also exist: higher-frequency modes due to multiple stick-slip cycles per period, and regions where there is not enough energy to actually produce any oscillation (i.e. the bow is always slipping), usually labelled as having decaying energy.


### What is playability?

According to [(Woodhouse, 2004)][Woodhouse2004], what makes a violin (or any bowed string instrument, for that matter) good is a combination of its _tone_ and its _playability_. The instrument's tone refers to its sonic signature, to how listeners may rate its sound, and is usually associated with the spectral shape of the sound, closely related to the resonance modes of the body and therefore to its impulse response. Playability, by contrast, refers to how _easy_ it is to obtain good tone from the instrument, where good tone means Helmholtz motion, regardless of its quality. These two dimensions are not necessarily correlated; it is well known that Stradivari violins, considered amongst the best in the world, have actually bad playability; unless played with great care and good tuning, they will not deliver what one would expect from them. This leads to a very important - and well-known by violin professors - corollary: the dream violin of a consolidated concertist might be a very bad choice for a beginner, since she would find it too difficult to get good tone from it (especially considering how expensive such a violin would probably be).

It follows from intuition that an instrument with a very wide region of the control space where there is Helmholtz motion (that is, with a wide Helmholtz band on a hypothetical multi-dimensional Schelleng diagram) will be easier to play, since a broader range of gestures will end up providing "good tone". Therefore, one may argue that the Schelleng diagram can be used as a (partial) playability indicator, assuming there is not much variability when changing other control variables such as terminal velocity. Similarly, instruments that show very short transient times in the Guettler diagram, that is, that very quickly achieve Helmholtz motion, are also very playable.

While this definition may prove quite intuitive to the reader, it is quite hard to translate it into something tangible that can be measured or compared. In this section, we will describe a framework, building on what was presented in [(Llimona, 2015)][Llimona2015], for talking about concepts such as playability.
