In his well-known paper from 1973, Schelleng studies (as discussed in the [regime maps](regime_maps) section) what a string being bowed under static conditions (i.e. bow velocity, force, etc. held constant) must fulfill in order to have a Helmholtz oscillation be self-sustained. 
He provides two inequations that relate the model space (string impedance, friction coefficients, dashpot impedance as a body model) and the control space (bow-bridge relative distance, bow force, and bow velocity). 
In those equations, bow force and bow-bridge distance have different exponents - and that is reflected on the well-known Schelleng diagram, which shows that a regime map on a log-log domain containing these two parameters displays a band where Helmholtz motion is possible. 

One of the sections in (Woodhouse, 1993) contains the probably most notable contribution to the study of the interplay between an instrument body characterization such as the driving-point admittance, which belongs to the model space, and a playability-oriented regime map. 
In his paper, the author presents one of the inequations provided by Schelleng, by explaining its derivation, and then he provides a critique to one of the several over-simplifications Schelleng makes - the assumption that the instrument body can be represented by an ideal dashpot alone. 
Then, he proceeds to develop the conditions for a generic, frequency-dependent driving-point admittance. 
The extended model reduces to Schelleng's version if the admittance is that of the system he had assumed. 

## Woodhouse's generalized formulation for a given admittance

An ideal Helmholtz motion can be described as a square-shaped velocity wave, with the wave parameters given by the geometry of the string. 
In short, if the string is bowed faster or further away from the bridge the amplitude of the resulting motion will be higher. 

In his paper, Woodhouse focuses on the minimum bow force required to achieve Helmholtz motion assuming everything else is fixed.

$$ f_{min} = A \frac{2v_b}{\beta^2 Y_0^2 (\mu_s -\mu_d)} $$
