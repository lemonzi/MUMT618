One of the sections in (Woodhouse, 1993) contains the probably most
notable contribution to the study of the interplay between an instrument
body characterization such as the driving-point admittance, which belongs
to the model space, and a playability-oriented regime map. In his paper,
the author presents one of the inequations presented by (Schelleng, 1973)
in his original paper, where the conditions that the bowing paramters (the
position on the control space) have to fulfill to allow Helmholtz motion
are introduced.

After a thorough explanation of the equation, the author provides
a critique to one of the several over-simplifications it makes
- the assumption that the instrument body can be represented by an ideal
dashpot alone - and proceeds to develop the conditions for a generic,
frequency-dependent driving-point admittance. The extended model reduces
to Schelleng's version if the admittance is that of the system he had
assumed.
